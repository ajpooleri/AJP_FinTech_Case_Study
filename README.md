## Overview and Origin
Curu, founded in 2016 by University of Maryland (UMD) graduates David Potter and Abb Kapoor, is a lead recovery service that helps loan applicants build up their eligibility. The idea came about when Potter and Kapoor, in their sophomore year at UMD, were rejected by apartment complexes around campus as both of them did not have any established credit. This experienced inspired them to found Curu, which helps to build a more inclusive credit system and eliminates rejection from credit-based decisions. Currently, they are utilizing Crunchbase seed funding and have raised three million dollars for their start-up through 14 investors.  

## Business Activities:
Unfortunately, bank lenders reject a majority of people who apply for loans or lines of credit -- up to 90% of applicants. The consequences of a rejection like this are two-fold: it is a bad experience for the applicants (who will struggle to get the funding they need), and lenders lose out on valuable business. The company's customers, in turn, are both the applicants and the lenders. In terms of market size, according to 2019 Census Bureau population estimates, there were 255.2 million Americans above the age of 18. Out of 2,076 adults surveyed, they each borrowed an average of $11,657.49 for the year. After multiplying this amount by the total adult population size, that comes to ~$2.97 trillion loaned, which we can use as our total market size of lending activity. The Federal Reserve listed the average personal interest rate for a 24 month loan as 9.63% in 1Q 2020. Therefore, the current yearly market revenue for banks would be $286,491,676,442 after multipying the total amount lended by the Federal Reserve's estimatated interest rate. Curu utilizes automation; their mobile application allows for total automation of credit building.  
## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? Curu is under Financial Services, specifically in the Robo-Advising domain, but can arguably be in Lending and Credit Approval domains as well. However, the company itself does not lend; as mentioned before, Curu partners with lenders to fund loans by building applicant eligibility.  
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
* What are the other major companies in this domain? Credit Karma and Credit Sesame, consumer credit reporting companies, and Mint, a personal finance management and bill payment service, are Curu's biggest competitors. The major trend with these companies is to simplify credit for those with little to no experience by making management less complicated for the user. However, this is unsustainable; at the end of the day, the user will still have little knowledge about the credit system. Curu, unlike its competitors, focuses on unwinding these complications for the user, making credit easier to understand. They specifically target millenials in becoming financially literate by signing them up for their first line of credit and continuing to advise them as they build their credit.  
## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
